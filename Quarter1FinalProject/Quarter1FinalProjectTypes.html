      <div class="grid-item"> Rocket League is an online sports game where you take control of a car, and try to hit a ball in a goal, much like soccer,
                              but instead of people kicking a ball, you use cars. The typical game involves two teams of three people all trying to hit
                              a ball into the opponents goal. It is a cooperative game, but it is less cooperative of a game than Overwatch.</div>
      <div class="grid-item"> Skyrim </div>
      <div class="grid-item"> <img src="skyrim.jpg" alt="a picture of the cover of skyrim" title="a picture of the cover of skyrim" height="190" width="195" align="center" /> </div>
      <div class="grid-item"> Skyrim is a single player game where you take control of a warrior, theif, or mage back in medeival times, and you play through the main questline,
                              gathering new items and strength as you go. It is entirely offline and single player, so your own skills, and your own
                              gear determine if you win fights in this game.</div>
