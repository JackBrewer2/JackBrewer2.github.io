        <div class="grid-item grid-item1" > These are some the important equations: </div>
        <div class="grid-item"> Velocity    (V = X / T) </div>
          <div class="grid-item"> <img src="velocity.jpeg" alt="a picture of velocity" title="a picture of velocity" height="190" width="195" align="center" /> </div>
          <div class="grid-item"> Often the building block for most of the premise of Physics, this equation has you divide the distance by the total time to give the velocity, assuming acceleration was constant throughout.</div>
        <div class="grid-item"> Force (F = M * A) </div>
          <div class="grid-item"> <img src="force.jpeg" alt="a picture of force" title="a picture of force" height="190" width="195" align="center" /> </div>
          <div class="grid-item"> An easy to understand equation, Newton's second law regards force. To find it, just multiple the objects mass by its acceleration to get the force acting on it.  </div>
        <div class="grid-item"> Energy (E = M * C^2) </div>
          <div class="grid-item"> <img src="energy.jpeg" alt="a picture of energy" title="a picture of energy" height="190" width="195" align="center" /> </div>
          <div class="grid-item"> The most famous equation in the world. This equation can be used to calculate energy as long as mass is understood, because the C is equal to the speed of light, which does not change.</div>
