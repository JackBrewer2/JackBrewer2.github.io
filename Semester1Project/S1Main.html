          Physics is the branch of science which deals with matter and its relation to energy.
          It involves study of physical and natural phenomena around us. Examples of these phenomena are formation of rainbow, occurrence eclipse, the fall of
          things from up to down, the cause of sunset and sunrise, formation of shadow and many more.
